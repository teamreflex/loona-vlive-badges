UserScript to show member name badges on chats with their confirmed accounts.

![example](/example.png)

### Install
- Install a userscript extension in your browser, such as TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, or ViolentMonkey.
- Go to the script [here](https://github.com/teamreflex/loona-vlive-badges/raw/master/loona-vlive-badges.user.js)
- Confirm installation, now go to a currently live vlive and it should be working.

### Caveats
- Script was whipped up in a few minutes, so it's a little finicky.
- Only works in live chats.
- Missing Choerry's vlive IDs.
